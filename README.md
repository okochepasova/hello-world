Part of the GitHub tutorial.

Hello,
My name is Olga Kochepasova.
I'm 21 years old and I graduated from college with an Associates' Degree in Computer Science.
I can program in Java, Python, PHP, and C#.
I have some knowledge of HTML 5 and CSS.

I'm currently looking for a job or an internship in the programming field.
If someone is willing to help me out, I would greatly appreciate it.
